# Towards LLM-based semantic analysis of historical legal documents

The preservation of legal documents such as notarial ones is of vital importance as they are evidence of legal transactions between the involved entities through the years, serving as historical legal knowledge bases. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their ability to analyze big data and generate content (much faster and relatively better than humans do alone) has created new perspectives in many fields, including law. Motivated by the significant potential of LLMs, we investigate the capabilities and limitations of using them in semantically analyzing legal documents through experimentation with two most prevalent LLMs i.e., ChatGPT-3.5 and Gemini/Bard. The goal is to emphasize automated and faster semantic analysis of documents, placing questions (prompts) concerning the type and subject of contracts, the recognition of the involved named entities and their relationship(s) e.g., landlord-tenant or family relationships. The experimental results conducted with digitized contract documents that have been converted from handwritten Greek originals using Transkribus AI-powered platform for text recognition and transcription. Evaluated against the results obtained from a human expert, LLMs performed better in terms of precision but not in recall.
